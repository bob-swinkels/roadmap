# How to Learn C Roadmap

Teaching yourself C is very difficult, but it is doable.

To start, get a copy of K&R aka [The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language). 

Begin working through it, either writing the code yourself or using [example code from this solutions guide](https://clc-wiki.net/wiki/K&R2_solutions).

In parallel, do the [h0mbre C Course](https://github.com/h0mbre/Learning-C). Work through as much of h0mbre's material as you can until you get stuck, and then look up the correct chapter in K&R. 

Keep doing this until you have finished all of the assignments in the h0mbre course. 

This will take a while, but the secret is to use the two in parallel. 

Don't worry about learning advanced data structures or algorithms beyond what is in h0mbre's assignments. 

Once you are done with this curriculum, you will be ready for more advanced material along this path like [reverse engineering](hardstuff.md) and [binary exploits](pwn.md).
