# PWN and Binary Exploitation Roadmap 

This is our path to learn how to write binary exploits and become a wizard. 

## Prerequisites ##

Binary exploitation, or pwn, requires a familiarity with C and a scripting language (preferrably python).  

It is highly recommended you have completed ['Learn the Hard Stuff the Slow Way'](/hardstuff.md).

## Progression of the PWN ##
The following site is recommended as the primary way to learn

* [Nightmare](https://github.com/guyinatuxedo/nightmare/tree/master/modules)

Once you have completed this course, then you can go and look at all the other 1000 resources and learn about Windows and everything else. For now, keep your eyes on the prize and do the entire thing.

## Discord 
If you get stuck on something for hours on end and google can't answer your question, try asking in the discord (or if you just feel like talking about cool security things). Here is a link to it <https://discord.gg/p5E3VZF>

Also if you notice any typos or mistakes, feel free to mention it in the Discord. With how much content is here, there is bound to be at least one.
