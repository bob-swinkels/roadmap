# How to Learn Binary Exploitation Roadmap 

Trying to learn PWN and Binex but can't get it down? This is our path to learn how to write binary exploits and become a wizard. 

If you are looking for how to learn heap exploitation, [checkout this page](/heap.md).

## Prerequisites ##

Binary exploitation, or pwn, requires a familiarity with C and a scripting language (preferrably python).  

It is highly recommended you have completed ['Learn the Hard Stuff the Slow Way'](/hardstuff.md).

## Progression of the PWN ##
The following repo is recommended as the primary way to learn. 

* [Nightmare](https://github.com/hoppersroppers/nightmare)

Nightmare was originally written by [guyinatuxedo](https://github.com/guyinatuxedo/nightmare), I just made a hilariously hard fork and added in a bunch of other resources. I want to be very clear that I don't take credit for any of the content in this course, I'm just an aggregator. 

## Discord 
If you get stuck on something for hours on end and google can't answer your question, try asking in the Nightmare discord (or if you just feel like talking about cool security things). Here is a link to it <https://discord.gg/p5E3VZF>. Again, Roppers doesn't have anything to do with this Discord, it's just a great place to learn. 

Also if you notice any typos or mistakes, feel free to mention it in the Discord. With how much content is here, there is bound to be at least one.
