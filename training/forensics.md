# Forensics Roadmap

Are you trying to learn how to do forensics, whether for a CTF challenge or for a DFIR job?

This is our recommendation for a starting point. 

From the Roppers CTF Course:

* Complete [File Forensics](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/course/view.php?id=7#section-4).
* Complete [Host and Memory Forensics](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/course/view.php?id=7#section-8)
* Complete [Network Forensics](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/course/view.php?id=7#section-6)

There is a lot to learn here, but this is a decent start.
