# How to Learn Reverse Engineering Roadmap

This is the first step of our reverse engineering roadmap. 

After years of trying to teach students and trying to teach ourselves, we came up with a curriculum to learn C, Assembly, debugging, and reverse-engineering all at the same time. It is a lot of work, but is the best way to learn out there.

This course prepares you completely for more advanced reverse engineering and binary exploitation.

Complete this course. [https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/course/view.php?id=4](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/course/view.php?id=4)

Once you have finished the course, you will be ready for some specialized training:

* [A Great Crack-Me Tutorial](https://nora.codes/tutorial/an-intro-to-x86_64-reverse-engineering/)
* I still need to make a good Malware RE Tutorial
* [Basic Buffer Overflow Tutorial](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/course/view.php?id=4#section-27)
