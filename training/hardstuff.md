# How to Learn Reverse Engineering Roadmap

This is the first step of our reverse engineering roadmap. 

After years of trying to teach students and trying to teach ourselves, we came up with a curriculum to learn C, Assembly, debugging, and reverse-engineering all at the same time. It is a lot of work, but is the best way to learn out there.

This course prepares you completely for more advanced reverse engineering and binary exploitation.

Complete this course. [https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/course/view.php?id=4](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/course/view.php?id=4)

Message @Dennis Devey to tell him you are starting the course, and then use the #reversing chatroom for any questions or discussions.
