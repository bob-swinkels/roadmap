# How to Learn Heap Exploitation Roadmap 

If you already know standard binex, you know what's coming up next... heap exploitation. Learning how to heap is the same beast but a different animal. 

## Prerequisites ##

You should already be pretty good at binary exploitation. If not, check out [my page on how to learn binex](/pwning.md). 

## Progression of the (Heap) PWN ##

This is still in progress but, roughly in order: 

1. <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/complex-data-structures/modules/cspath-heaps>
2. <https://azeria-labs.com/heap-exploitation-part-1-understanding-the-glibc-heap-implementation/>
3. <https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/heap-exploitation/>
4. <https://sources.debian.org/src/glibc/2.28-10/malloc/malloc.c/>
5. <https://azeria-labs.com/heap-exploitation-part-2-glibc-heap-free-bins/>
6. <https://azeria-labs.com/heap-exploit-development-part-1/>

[This course](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-heap-exploitation-part-1/) from Max Kamper is excellent, but requires money.

The real work is starting and grinding through <https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap> and <https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/25-heap/index.html> in parallel. 

If you finish both of these you'll be ready for most heap challenges you see in CTFs, it will just take quite some time to get comfortable.
