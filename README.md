<h2 id="switch">3. Learn Fundamentals or Compete in a CTF</h2> 

Depending on what you want to get out of this, you can either take our comprehensive computing fundamentals course, skipping the Linux and Python sections you have already completed, or you can advance forward to take a course on the basics of Capture the Flags, or a course on practical security.

#### Intro. to Computing
This is our flagship course, designed to give a beginner in the cyber security field the knowledge and skills required to be successful in the field. It teaches security fundamentals along with building a strong technical foundation that you will build on for years to come.

Learning Objectives: Hardware, Networking, Operating Systems, Power User

* [I want to learn about Computing Fundamentals](training/fundamentals.md)

#### Intro to Capture the Flags

Learn the basics of what is required to be successful in Capture the Flag competitions and compete in the picoCTF event.

Learning Objectives: CTFs, Forensics, Cryptography, Web-Exploitation

* [Fundamentals sounds boring. Let's go do some CTFs.](#ctfs)
* [I already know all that stuff. Give me something harder](#cnre)

#### Introduction to Security: How Security Works in the Real World

Learn security theory and execute defensive measures so that you are better prepared against threats online and in the physical world.

Learning Objectives: Security Theory, Practical Application, Real-World Examples
