# Security Education Roadmap

There are limitless resources out there to teach you the basics of computing and security, and finding the right place to start with that many options is almost impossible. 

Our philosophy at Ropper's Academy is that we provide you a straightforward roadmap and accompanying curriculum, and if you follow it, you will be better prepared for whatever comes next than any student who attempts to teach themself. 

If you're looking for our recommendations on how to get a job in security, [this is the link for you](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/library/breakIntoSecurity.html). It focuses on projects and demonstrating knowledge. 

On the other hand, the Ropper's Roadmap, which is where you are right now, is entirely focused on learning new material in the most efficient and entertaining way possible. It's a work in progress and will have you learn a great deal of very varied information.

## Quick Links

If you already know what you want to learn, click the links below. Otherwise, continue down the page and we will help find the right training for your skill level and what you want to improve.

### [Computing Fundamentals](training/fundamentals.md) 

This is the basic Ropper's fundamentals course and it is very nicely built out and will teach you most of what you need to know to be successful. 
  * [Linux Fundamentals](training/linux.md) 
  * [Web Fundamentals(IP)](training/web.md) 
  * [Python Fundamentals](training/python.md) 
  
### [Security Fundamentals](training/security.md) 

In this course we will provide the context needed to develop a technical understanding of security and how different roles fit into this. It is highly recommended that the student follows this course with [Professor Messer's Comptia Security+ Course](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-501/sy0-501-training-course/). Remember, passing certs is more about how well you study for it, than total understanding so really dive into Anki decks such as [this](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2145089484) and [this](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/352022978), as well as the many study guides out there freely available.

### [Networking Fundamentals(IP)](training/networking.md)

In this course you will learn how networking works at a practical level, before you go and hit the books to learn networking on a theoretical level like is required for the Comptia Network+ course. Again, once you finish the Ropper's practical material, use [Professor Messer's Comptia Network Course](https://www.professormesser.com/netplus-resources/). This is the blend of practical experience and theoretical knowledge that will make you both very skilled and very knowledgeable. Just like for Security, focus on studying more than watching videos, so that means Anki decks and study guides, but don't forget to load up Wireshark and look at those packets as you go along.

### [Capture the Flag Basics](training/ctf.md)

CTF's won't get you hired, but it will teach you a lot of material very quickly, as well as be a super entertaining way to do it. 

 * [Cryptography Fundamentals](training/crypto.md)
 * [Forensics Fundamentals(IP)](training/forensics.md)

### The Hard Stuff

Reverse engineering, binary exploitation, shellcoding, writing portable code...

To do "The Hard Stuff" you will need to learn C. Then you will need to use that knowledge of C to learn Assembly. Then you will need to use that knowledge of Assembly to become a Wizard. You can't just skip any of these steps. Follow them in order. 

* [Learn C(IP)](training/c.md) 
* [Reverse Engineering](training/hardstuff.md) 
* [Binary Exploitation](training/pwning.md)

### [Web Exploitation](training/web.md)

I don't care about web exploitation. Go and learn bug bounty somewhere else.
